Duration: 00:02

Welcome to the AI Exit-Readiness & Valuation Impact Calculator! This tool is designed to help financial professionals, like our persona **Jane Doe**, a Portfolio Manager at **Alpha Capital**, evaluate and articulate the value of Artificial Intelligence (AI) capabilities within a portfolio company, **InnovateTech**, as it prepares for an exit (e.g., sale or IPO).

In today's fast-paced market, a company's strategic integration and effective deployment of AI can significantly influence its attractiveness to potential acquirers and ultimately, its valuation. This codelab will guide you through using this application to systematically assess, quantify, and strategically communicate the AI story of a company.

The application provides a structured workflow, broken down into logical steps accessible via the sidebar navigation:
1.  **Setup and Introduction**: Define the key individuals and company involved.
2.  **Assessing AI Dimensions**: Evaluate the company's AI capabilities across specific criteria.
3.  **Calculating Exit-AI-R Score**: Quantify the overall AI readiness.
4.  **Projecting Valuation Uplift**: Translate AI readiness into a financial impact.
5.  **Crafting the Exit Narrative**: Generate a compelling story for stakeholders.

## Setting the Stage - Defining Your Context
Duration: 00:03

The first step in any assessment is to establish the context. This page allows you to personalize the analysis by entering details about the persona conducting the assessment, their firm, and the target company.

1.  **Navigate to "1. Setup and Introduction"** using the sidebar.
2.  You will see input fields for:
    *   **Persona Name**: The name of the individual performing the analysis (e.g., Jane Doe).
    *   **Firm Name**: The name of the firm or investment company (e.g., Alpha Capital).
    *   **Company Name**: The name of the company being assessed (e.g., InnovateTech).
3.  Feel free to change these names to reflect your own scenario. Once updated, these names will be used throughout the application to personalize the outputs.

This step ensures that all subsequent calculations and narratives are tailored to your specific situation, making the assessment highly relevant and impactful.

## Understanding and Assessing AI Dimensions
Duration: 00:05

With the context set, we now dive into the core assessment of the company's AI capabilities. This application breaks down AI readiness into three critical dimensions:

*   **Visible AI**: This refers to the tangible and easily observable aspects of AI within the company. Think about products, services, or internal processes that clearly leverage AI. It's about what external parties can readily see and understand as AI-driven.
*   **Documented AI**: This dimension focuses on the formalization and systematic management of AI efforts. This includes strategies, policies, intellectual property (IP), and internal documentation related to AI development, deployment, and governance. It's about how well the company has codified its AI initiatives.
*   **Sustainable AI**: This dimension assesses the long-term viability and growth potential of the company's AI capabilities. This involves factors like AI talent acquisition and retention, research and development investment, scalability of AI infrastructure, and adaptability to future AI advancements. It's about ensuring AI provides a lasting competitive advantage.

1.  **Navigate to "2. Assessing AI Dimensions"** using the sidebar.
2.  You will find three sliders, one for each dimension: **Visible AI Score**, **Documented AI Score**, and **Sustainable AI Score**.
3.  Adjust each slider to reflect your assessment of the company's performance in that specific AI dimension, on a scale of 0 to 100. A higher score indicates stronger performance.
4.  After adjusting the scores, click the **"Plot AI Dimensions Scores"** button. This will visually represent your assessment, providing a quick overview of the company's strengths and weaknesses across the AI dimensions.

<aside class="positive">
<b>Tip:</b> Consider involving different stakeholders within the company (e.g., R&D, Product, HR, Legal) to get a comprehensive and balanced perspective when setting these scores.

## Calculating Your Exit-AI-R Score
Duration: 00:04

Once you've assessed the individual AI dimensions, the next logical step is to combine them into a single, comprehensive **Exit-AI-R Score**. This score provides a quantitative measure of the company's overall AI readiness for an exit. Not all AI dimensions may be equally important for every company or every exit strategy, so this step allows you to assign relative importance through weighting.

1.  **Navigate to "3. Calculating Exit-AI-R Score"** using the sidebar.
2.  You will see three sliders for **Weights**: **Weight for Visible AI**, **Weight for Documented AI**, and **Weight for Sustainable AI**.
3.  Adjust these weights to reflect the relative importance you place on each AI dimension. For example, if you believe "Documented AI" is most crucial for a particular type of acquirer, you might assign it a higher weight.
4.  The application will automatically ensure that the sum of all three weights equals 1.0 (or 100%).
5.  After setting the weights, click the **"Calculate Exit-AI-R Score"** button. The application will then compute the overall score using the formula:

    $$ \text{Exit-AI-R Score} = (\text{Weight for Visible AI} \times \text{Visible AI Score}) + (\text{Weight for Documented AI} \times \text{Documented AI Score}) + (\text{Weight for Sustainable AI} \times \text{Sustainable AI Score}) $$

    The calculated score will be displayed, offering a single metric to summarize the company's AI exit-readiness.

## Projecting Valuation Uplift with AI
Duration: 00:05

A strong Exit-AI-R Score isn't just an abstract number; it has a tangible impact on a company's financial valuation, particularly in an M&A context. This section allows you to translate the AI readiness into a projected valuation uplift, specifically focusing on the EBITDA multiple.

1.  **Navigate to "4. Projecting Valuation Uplift"** using the sidebar.
2.  You will find two key input fields:
    *   **Baseline EBITDA Multiple**: This represents the company's valuation multiple based on its core business fundamentals, *before* accounting for any AI-driven premium. This is your starting point.
    *   **AI Premium Coefficient**: This coefficient determines how much each point of the Exit-AI-R Score translates into an additional multiple point. A higher coefficient implies that AI readiness has a stronger positive impact on valuation.
3.  Adjust these values based on your market knowledge and comparable company analysis.
4.  Once adjusted, click the **"Project Valuation Uplift"** button. The application will calculate the **Projected EBITDA Multiple** using the following formula:

    $$ \text{Projected EBITDA Multiple} = \text{Baseline EBITDA Multiple} + (\text{AI Premium Coefficient} \times (\text{Exit-AI-R Score} / 100)) $$

    This calculation provides a clear financial indication of how well-developed AI capabilities can enhance the company's market appeal and valuation.

<aside class="negative">
<b>Warning:</b> The AI Premium Coefficient is a critical assumption. Ensure it's based on sound market research and specific industry benchmarks related to AI-enabled businesses to avoid over- or under-estimating the valuation impact.

## Crafting a Compelling Exit Narrative
Duration: 00:03

The final step is to synthesize all the data and insights into a compelling narrative that can be presented to potential acquirers (strategic or financial buyers). A well-articulated story about a company's AI strengths can significantly differentiate it in the market and justify a higher valuation.

1.  **Navigate to "5. Crafting the Exit Narrative"** using the sidebar.
2.  Click the **"Generate Exit Narrative"** button.
3.  The application will compile all the information you've provided and the scores you've calculated into a structured report. This narrative will include:
    *   The context of the assessment (persona, firm, company).
    *   A summary of the AI dimension scores.
    *   The calculated Exit-AI-R Score.
    *   The projected valuation uplift based on the AI premium.
    *   A persuasive text explaining *why* the company's AI capabilities are valuable and how they contribute to its growth potential and competitive advantage.

This generated narrative serves as a powerful tool for Jane Doe to effectively communicate InnovateTech's AI story, positioning it for the most successful exit possible. You can use this narrative as a foundation for pitch decks, information memoranda, or investor presentations.
